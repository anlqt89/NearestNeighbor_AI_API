Introduction
 Software Developers at IBM are the backbone of our strategic initiatives to design, code, test, and provide industry-leading solutions that make the world run today - planes and trains take off on time, bank transactions complete in the blink of an eye and the world remains safe because of the work our software developers do. Whether you are working on projects internally or for a client, software development is critical to the success of IBM and our clients worldwide. At IBM, you will use the latest software development tools, techniques and approaches and work with leading minds in the industry to build solutions you can be proud of.
  

Your Role and Responsibilities
 Are you interested in pursuing a software development career? Have you heard about agile development, but want to learn more about how it ‘works’? Are you someone that has a foundational understanding of development or programming concepts, but want to take a less traditional path to achieve it?
  

What is an Apprenticeship?
 IBM Apprenticeship Program, which lasts approximately 12 months, is an official registered apprenticeship recognized by the Department of Labor (DOL). Every graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program receives a nationally-recognized credential from the DOL.
  
 During the apprenticeship duration, you will be required to complete specific learning hours and on the job training that has been outlined to ensure you are developing the skills and competencies essential to the role. You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM. 
  

Who you Are
 An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow. If you’ve had some experience with coding or development in the past, you’re exactly the type of candidate we’re looking for….
  
 Drive and eagerness to learn
 Strong problem solving and communication skills
 Able to work independently and take initiative, as well as work collaboratively and contribute to an agile team environment
 Some knowledge or experience in ONE or more of the following:
    
 Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, Objective-C, C/C++, Python, Ruby and/or functional languages (Haskell, Scala, F#, Clojure)
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
 Design Thinking
 Hypothesis driven development
 Social coding
 Agile principles
 Container development using tools such as Docker or Vagrant
 Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools)



What’s the Experience? 
 As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.
  
 As a Cloud Support Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer. Best of all, you are a contributing member of your team, putting forward ideas, taking on responsibilities and making choices about how you get the job done just like any other IBMer.
  
 Must be local or willing to relocate to the location(s) listed in this posting. No relocation assistance is available for this position.

 #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
  



    We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
  



    But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
  



    Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
  



    So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
  



Cisco COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements The health and safety of Cisco's employees, customers, and partners is a top priority. Our goal is to protect and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection for strong business resiliency during the pandemic. Therefore, Cisco may require new hires to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 if the role requires business-related travel, meeting with customers/partners (including visiting third-party sites on behalf of Cisco), attending trade events, and Cisco office entry, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, and in countries where COVID-19 vaccination is legally required. The company will consider legally required accommodations/exceptions for medical, religious, and other reasons as per the requirements of the role and in accordance with applicable law. Additional information will be provided to candidates about the requirements and accommodation process at the offer time based on region.","San Jose, CA"

 The Clinical Insights Program introduces new technology via a personalized phone application and other wearable devices to capture data and provide clarity for the treatment of people living with MS. We are changing the paradigm of MS care in a positive way.
 The Nurse Care Partner (NCP) will directly interact with PwMS using video calls and chat messaging via the App and under the guidance of the Neurology Clinic’s standard of practice. He/She will conduct a baseline assessment of PwMS and track any changes over time. The NCP will serve as a resource for PwMS by educating and by helping to answer questions and to address concerns that may arise. Overall, the NCP’s goal is to support PwMS through their MS care journey. The NCP will also directly interact with the clinics to offer real time feedback, report the progress of PwMS, and provide a comprehensive clinical insights report for the provider. This position will require a balance of clinical knowledge, healthcare navigational skills, and empathy for those people living with MS.

Pit.AI Technologies is taking on one of the most exciting challenges of our time, namely solving intelligence, in one of the most competitive industries ever, investment management!
 The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
 We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
 We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

 Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

 This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

 The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

 Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

 We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

 Requirements:

 Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
 Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
 Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
 No finance or machine learning experience is required.

And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world.

 What we're building and why we're building it.
 Fetch is a build-first technology company creating a rewards program to power the world. Over the last 5 years we've grown from 0 to 18M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with brands.
 It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the ""you get to use our product!"" cop-out. We're talkin' real, explicit value. Fetch points, perhaps.
 Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. - Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?
 That's why we're building the world's rewards platform. A closed-loop, standardized rewards layer across all consumer behavior that will lead to happier shoppers and stronger brands.
 Fetch Rewards is an equal employment opportunity employer.
 The Role:

PhD or Master's with equivalent experience in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science or any other Quantitative field. Publication record is a plus.
2+ years of work experience in data science
Fluency in Python and at least one ML framework (Tensorflow, PyTorch, JAX, Keras, etc)
Experience developing + deploying a ML model based on tabular data, such as Recommender Systems, Anomaly Detection, Bandit testing, Graph Networks.
Entrepreneurial and big-picture bend of mind for applications of machine learning in a consumer tech world
A penchant for fast prototyping and deployment and ability to pivot quickly to pursue impactful solutions
Curiosity and passion for solving new problems with creative approaches
Ability to successfully collaborate with both business users and engineers in solution development, deployment, and maintenance

Experience in CPG/Retail domain and/or analytics at app-based B2C companies
Familiarity with Big Data frameworks like Snowflake, Google Cloud, and AWS services
Effective communication, ability to translate and explain technical issues to non-technical team members

About the Company 



    Our client believes that the next leap forward in applied AI lies in active learning systems and techniques like reinforcement learning.

Arena uses simulations and your real environment to train active learning agents that can safely and quickly learn new tasks to improve your future outcomes. 
   


    As a software engineer at Arena, you will build the next generation of machine learning software. We have 3 main areas of focus: Core Intelligence-ML Modeling, Telemetry-Impact & Algorithmic Health, and AI interfaces. You will be involved in building out functionality for all 3 areas.

- Insurance Agents - These advisors tend to view insurance as the solution to every problem.
- Fee Based Planners - These advisors often focus their entire business model around charging fees for plans without actually helping clients to implement them.
The Heckmann Financial team simplifies our client’s lives and improves their plan efficiency by providing all of these areas so clients can implement their multi-faceted plan at one firm. We specialize in creating income distribution plans that adapt to today's changing financial environments. We help clients get the most out of their financial lives by maximizing the probability of successful outcomes based on several key factors including taxes, market environment, health care costs, social security optimization, longevity, and legacy goals. Most importantly, we take a collaborative approach to planning. We educate, and the client makes decisions - not the other way around. Heckmann Financial has been recognized by both Barron’s and the Financial Times as one of the top financial advisors in the country.

You are a flexible, self-motivated teammate with a can-do approach who brings energy and enthusiasm to the role

 The Purpose of Your Role Our associates have rewarding interactions with clients while providing a world class client experience.

You have superb interpersonal skills, remarkable attention to detail and enjoy managing multiple tasks at once

Our robust training will put you on a proven career path that streamlines your growth through our wealth management network, developing the skills to have meaningful conversations with clients. You will not fail due to a lack of training or onboarding!


 The Value You Deliver


A key member of the team, you are offering support to Fidelity’s most valuable clients daily, directly impacting the success of the business
Engaging with customers, responding to inquiries and providing product and service level guidance, you will help increase customer dedication and build relationships
After training, you’ll process equity transactions, mutual funds, and fixed-income trades

Over the last 5 years, we've grown from 0 to 18M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with brands.It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the ""you get to use our product!"" cop-out. We're talkin' real, explicit values. Fetch points, perhaps.Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?That's why we're building the world's rewards platform.

Business Network Design Services (“BNDS”) is a network team within Enterprise Technology that designs and implements network infrastructure to directly support business units including LAN, MAN, WAN, internet, WiFi, and voice network services. BNDS engineers work closely with other technical teams to provide the network services, including the strategy/architecture team, network operations, global information security, wireless and cloud teams among others. This is an opportunity to build networks for Disney’s world-class business units including filmed & TV production, media & broadcast, and content distribution. We are seeking a dynamic individual who is a problem solver, creative, has a strong sense of ownership and initiative, collaborates and communicates effectively, and is interested in continually learning new networking technologies.


 Key Responsibilities:

 The Network Engineer (“SNE”) provides network design and consulting services to business units and peer groups, develops network design plans, and drives implementation of network solutions. As such, it is a hybrid role requiring a balance of technical, people and project skills.

 Consulting: Meet regularly with business unit technologists to understand technical strategy, gather requirements, and translate requirements into technology solutions. This requires relationship building / management skills, planning, customer service, and problem-solving skills in serving as an interface between Enterprise Tech and the Business Units.

Leave should be requested as far in advance as possible and with at least sixty days notice in order to minimize patient cancellations. All unscheduled absences must be properly communicated, and patients should be rescheduled within time frame as specified in department's policies.

 Ensure supervised institutions’ compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including consumer protection
 Facilitate the stability of the financial system of the United States

Why Charlie Health?
 Young people across the country need our help. The sad reality is that a mental health crisis has taken hold of our most vulnerable population—leading to record levels of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and self-harm. From Manhattan to Montana, this reality is compounded by issues of access, both geographic and financial. The mental health landscape is systemically broken, and our young people are suffering as a result. 
Charlie Health has set out on a mission to reimagine how high acuity care is delivered to young people and families in crisis. Our initial offering is a virtual intensive outpatient program, which places peers with similar mental health experiences and goals into customized virtual groups. Our team of masters-level clinicians lead groups multiple times per week to deliver a higher level of care.
 Our goal is to help young people and families heal together. Through a combination of exceptional medical and psychological care, engaged community partnerships, and best-in-class technology, we provide an unparalleled approach to recovery support that serves individual needs in an integrated way. Join us in our mission to ensure that every young person—regardless of location or socioeconomic status—can get the care that they deserve.

 About the Role
 As one of the first members of Charlie Health's DevOps team, you will play an essential role in establishing our DevOps culture.
 We're looking for someone who is impact-orientated and willing to partner closely with the rest of the product development team. You'll thrive here if you find greenfield work energizing, have a high quality bar, and prefer to iterate to success.
 This is a unique opportunity to impact millions of lives while building something from scratch, so we're looking for someone who is inspired by our mission and as excited about this opportunity as we are.
 Responsibilities

Develop and deliver highly-available, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure using Terraform
Monitor, tune, and improve application performance
Improve and maintain our CI/CD pipelines leveraging build tools such as Bazel
Partner with your teammates and manager to define our long-term DevOps strategy
Accelerate code velocity by identifying and automating complex tasks such as local environment setup, deploy rollbacks, and secret management
Identify bottlenecks and implement improvements to engineering processes, tools, and procedures. We're early and the expectation of folks joining at this stage is that you'll play a huge part in setting and improving how we work
Promote a culture of collaboration and learning across the engineering, product, and design teams via mentoring, documentation, presentations, or other knowledge sharing methods

Requirements

Significant professional experience standing up infrastructure with Terraform or other infrastructure as code tools, building CI/CD pipelines, and containerizing applications with Docker
Deep expertise authoring automation using scripting languages such as bash
Familiarity with a cloud ecosystem such as AWS, GCP, or Azure (AWS preferred)
Excellent at managing ambiguity. Masterful ability to break down big, messy problems (demanding requirements, bugs, etc) into smaller parts with tractable solutions and clear iterations
Meaningful scope within an application engineering team. Experience making or contributing to important technical tradeoff decisions with cross team implications
Growth mindset and a sense of humor. You welcome feedback and when you stumble you get back up. You adapt quickly in a fast-paced environment and you enjoy fostering an environment that prioritizes fun, learning, and growth

Perks
 Our mentality is to find the best, attract the best, and pay the best talent—which is why we prioritize quality over quantity of hires. While we offer zero-stress medical, dental, and vision coverage, competitive salaries, and a generous PTO policy, we're way more excited to tell you about a few ""perks"" that are unique to Charlie Health. We've spent time thinking through what it means to be a mental health company and how we can better align these additional perks with our mission and values.
 First and foremost, we believe that no one should ever have to compromise on their mental or physical health. This is why we offer a monthly wellness stipend for the mindfulness, talk therapy, nutrition, or fitness app or program of your choice (Headspace, TalkSpace, Noom, Peloton, gym membership, etc.). We also offer complimentary yoga sessions for you and your loved ones that are hosted by one of our licensed instructors. Our team is big on self-care, and we are committed to helping our employees live happy and healthy lives.
 We also want you to live and see our mission in action. We encourage every employee—regardless of department—to shadow our vIOP sessions once per month. And while it's motivating to experience the care that we provide to patients, we also want to collectively celebrate their successes. This is why we host quarterly events to recognize alumni of our program and bring together patients and team members around shared experiences. Whether it be through a cooking class, a magic show, a comedy act, or a virtual talent competition, we want to uplift our patients and teammates, together. #LI-Remote

 So—what do you think?
 If you've made it this far, well, we're excited to meet you too. Just one more thing that we want you to remember: we pride ourselves on our meritocratic, performance-driven culture. There are lives on the line, and we have young people to save. There's no room for complacency. Your scope of responsibility and opportunity to make a difference will be uncapped at Charlie Health, but we need your commitment that you will work tirelessly for our patients, parents, and partners. At the end of day, our team is committed to helping you succeed at Charlie Health because when you succeed, our patients succeed, and we get one step closer to solving the mental health crisis. We're hopeful that this role will give you the experience to go and do whatever you want in life but the fulfillment to make you never want to leave our team. We look forward to solving the mental health crisis, together.
 Please do not call our public clinical admissions line in regards to this or any other job posting.  Recruiting agencies, please do not submit unsolicited referrals for this or any open role. We have a roster of agencies with whom we partner, and we will not pay any fee associated with unsolicited referrals.

 At Charlie Health, we value being an Equal Opportunity Employer. We strive to cultivate an environment where individuals can be their authentic selves.

We value diverse perspectives to help us provide essential mental health and substance use disorder treatments to all young people.

  Summary
  ABOUT US
 
 Founded in 1961, Yves Saint Laurent was the first couture house to introduce the concept of luxury prêt-à-porter in a 1966 collection called ‘Rive Gauche’, synonymous with youth and freedom. This shift represented a first critical step in the modernization of fashion and revolutionized the socio- cultural landscape.
 
 In 1999, the luxury goods division of the Kering Group acquired Yves Saint Laurent and, under the creative direction of Anthony Vaccarello since April
  2016, continues to position the house at the summit of the luxury universe.
  Today, Saint Laurent collections include women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, shoes, handbags, small leather goods, jewelry, scarves, ties and eyewear.

 The Emergency Center is a level 1 trauma center 64 bed unit which includes a 7 bed pediatric emergency area. The Emergency Center provides a unique opportunity to experience a variety of patient situations including care of trauma, cardiac, stroke, pediatric, and burn patients. While in the Emergency Center you will orient to all areas of the Emergency Center.
  Triage: Triage training will offer you the best view of how the emergency center flows. As a triage nurse you are the decision maker for each patient that is waiting to be seen. You are instructed on the ESI 5 tier index triage system and will begin using this in making decisions on how sick a patient may be and if it is safe for them to wait or not. This again is the most important part of your orientation, because it will carry over into your patient care as a primary nurse to all patients in the Emergency Center. As an experienced nurse, you may have previously used this system and therefore, you will adapt to how this Emergency Center utilizes ESI.

Job Description:


   At Bank of America, we’re creating real, meaningful relationships with individuals and businesses across the country. Each day, we connect with 67 million clients through a growing specialist workforce and our world-class digital platform. With each relationship and connection, we are looking to provide care and guidance for our clients when they need us most – whether they are just starting out, buying a home, building a family or planning for retirement. As part of our commitment, we are looking for the next generation of Financial Advisors—those with a passion for growing a long-term career and a drive to make our clients’ financial lives better.
  
 If you are an individual who is passionate about helping clients reach their financial goals, join Bank of America’s 
  Advisor Development Program and become an investment specialist in one of over 4,000 financial center locations nationwide. From day one, you will receive training from our-award winning 
  Academy at Bank of America, including hands-on practice, personalized coaching and dedicated support throughout your on-boarding experience. 
  The Academy offers a defined path to becoming an advisor through a multi-stage training program, one that provides you with the necessary experience and skills to succeed in your role and throughout your career journey.
  
 As a 
  Financial Solutions Advisor Stage I (FSA I), your journey begins obtaining your Securities Industry licenses, where you receive dedicated and personalized classes for your Securities Industry Essentials [SIE], Series 7 and Series 66 Exams. Once you obtain your licenses, you will be taught the foundational skills needed to be an advisor – from acquiring, building and managing client relationships to considering a client’s complex financial picture and guiding them with advice and solutions to help them live their best financial lives, all while humanizing financial interactions. Once you have reached your key milestones, you will begin working in a financial center where you will help to deliver Bank of America’s core banking, investment solutions and approach to client care. We will equip you with everything you need as you move through the stages of development
  
 Once you have demonstrated success as a licensed Financial Solutions Advisor Stage I, you will typically progress into the next role, Financial Solutions Advisor Stage II, where you will continue to practice the skills you’ve learned by growing and deepening relationships within a portfolio of clients. As a successful Financial Solutions Advisor Stage II, you will have the opportunity to advance in many roles within Bank of America and Merrill. The Academy will support you along the way with dedicated programs, tools and resources throughout your career journey.
  
 This position is subject to SAFE Act registration requirements. Pursuant to the SAFE Act requirements, all employees engaged in residential loan mortgage originations must register with the federal registry system and remain in good standing. Since your position requires SAFE Act registration, you will be required to register and to submit to the required SAFE Act background check and registration process. Failure to obtain and/or maintain SAFE Act registration may result in your immediate termination.
